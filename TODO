Tasks needing to be done.

AMQP Interface:
  - Add Qpid Proton to the lookup/dependencies of CMake
  - Proton: Add API hooks to the driver for foreign FD control (for the tap fd)
  - Write the code that reacts to a new connection by establishing:
     o An outgoing link for all datagrams
     o An incoming link for multicast datagrams
     o An incoming link for the local MAC address
  - Eventually refactor the above to include an incoming link for
    "configure-me" functionality

Main Program:
  - Build lanqp main-loop around the Proton driver (consider using the
    nexus server as a base)
     o nexus provides resilient connections, timers, signal handlers, etc.
  - Add a config-file reader for static configuration
  - Add event generation (syslog, etc.) for normal operation and errors
